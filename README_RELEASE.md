# Melange application source (release)

Filtered, history-free application source for Melange, published from local Melange branch `main` at commit `300cbe4172ac4ea7a20faffe0707df0ce0ec9882`. Filter: `ops/release_lib/export.py` rules (roots `fec/`, `requirements.txt`, `ops/`; extension allowlist; 5 MB blob cap; excludes). Paths are kept as in the source (`ops/github` is not remapped to `.github`, so the workflow files under `ops/github` never run here. The two workflows published under `.github/workflows` (`desktop-windows.yml`, `desktop-installer-acceptance.yml`) are carried separately and run on a push to `main` that touches their path filters, or on a manual dispatch).

See `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.json` and `FILTER_REPORT.txt`.
